## 1. Project Summary

Excalidraw is an open-source virtual whiteboard tool that enables users to create hand-drawn style diagrams, wireframes, and sketches directly in the browser. Its infinite canvas, intuitive shape tools, and hand-drawn aesthetic make it suitable for software architects, designers, educators, and anyone who needs lightweight visual communication. The editor is available both as a standalone web application at excalidraw.com and as a reusable React component library published to npm as `@excalidraw/excalidraw`.

The project is structured as a monorepo separating the embeddable library from the hosted application. The library exposes a rich API for rendering, interacting with, and exporting canvas elements, while the full application adds real-time collaboration (via WebSockets), end-to-end encryption, Firebase cloud storage, and PWA offline support. This separation lets third-party developers embed the editor in their own products while excalidraw.com serves as a first-class reference implementation.

Core value propositions include: zero-install browser experience, local-first autosave with IndexedDB, end-to-end encrypted sharing links, real-time multi-user collaboration, and a clean npm package that can be dropped into any React project in minutes.

## 3. Architecture Overview

The system is layered: foundational math and utility packages feed up through element domain logic into the main editor library, which is consumed by the hosted web application.

## 6. Key Conventions

From `CLAUDE.md` and observed codebase patterns:

### Repository Structure

- **Library work** belongs in `packages/*`. All features of the editor core, rendering, element logic, and shared utilities live here.
- **Application work** belongs in `excalidraw-app/`. App-specific features such as collaboration, Firebase storage, Sentry, and PWA configuration are kept out of the library.
- **Integration examples** live in `examples/` and must remain lightweight demonstrations.

### Development Workflow

1. Run `yarn test:update` before every commit to update test snapshots and verify correctness.
2. Run `yarn test:typecheck` to validate TypeScript — the project uses strict mode throughout.
3. Run `yarn fix` to auto-correct formatting and linting issues before raising a PR.

### Package System

- Yarn workspaces manages the monorepo; packages reference each other as workspace siblings.
- In development (Vite and Vitest), internal `@excalidraw/*` imports resolve to TypeScript source via path aliases defined in `vitest.config.mts` and `excalidraw-app/vite.config.mts`. Published artifacts use compiled ESM output from `dist/`.
- esbuild is used for library packages; Vite is used only for the app.
- All packages are strictly typed; no `any` escapes without explicit justification.

### State Management

- Editor state uses Jotai atoms; the editor store (`editor-jotai.ts`) is scoped independently from the app store (`app-jotai.ts`).
- App state is the source of truth for active elements, tool selection, viewport, and user settings.

### Testing

- Tests are co-located with source files (`.test.ts` / `.test.tsx` siblings).
- Coverage thresholds enforced by Vitest: 60% lines, 70% branches, 63% functions, 60% statements.
- jsdom is the test environment; canvas is mocked via `vitest-canvas-mock`.

### Code Style

- Prettier config from `@excalidraw/prettier-config`.
- ESLint config from `@excalidraw/eslint-config` extended per-package.
- Husky + lint-staged run checks on pre-commit.
